/*
 * Exercise 13.18: Define an Employee class that contains an employee name and a unique employee identifier. Give the class a default constructor and a constructor that takes a string representing the employeeâ€™s name. Each constructor should generate a unique ID by incrementing a static data member.
 *
 * Exercise 13.19: Does your Employee class need to define its own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why not? Implement whatever copy-control members you think Employee needs.
