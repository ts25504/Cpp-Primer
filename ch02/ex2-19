definition:

the pointer is "points to" anyother type.

the reference is "another name" of an object.

key difference:

a reference is another name of an already existing object. a pointer is an object in its own right.
Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to refer to a different object. a pointer can be assigned and copied.
a reference always get the object to which the reference was intially bound. a single pointer can point to several different objects over its lifetime.
a reference must be initialized. a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined.
